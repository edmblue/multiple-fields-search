This one took of me a few hours to understand how to filter the search properly but at the end I was able to recreate de project alone and successfully, I'm really really happy and can't wait to do more and more!

I also learned this event called 'change', I didn't know it existed so my knowledge is growing each time a little more

<b>note: I used a HTML and CSS template... I only focused on the JavaScript code<b>
